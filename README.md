# CoffeeMachine
This Java program represents a simple text-based coffee machine simulation. Here's a detailed description of the code:

1. **Package and Imports:**
   - The code is organized into a package named `CoffeeMachine`.
   - It imports a custom `Coffee` class from the `CoffeeTypes` package, which presumably contains different types of coffee with their properties.

2. **Class: CoffeeMachine:**
   - Attributes:
      - `water`, `milk`, `beans`, `cups`, and `money` represent the current resources and earnings of the coffee machine.
   - Constructor:
      - Initializes the coffee machine with specified amounts of water, milk, coffee beans, disposable cups, and money.
   - Main Method:
      - Creates a `Scanner` object to take user input.
      - Initializes a `CoffeeMachine` object with initial resource values.
      - Enters an infinite loop prompting the user to choose an action: buy, fill, take, remaining, or exit.
      - Based on the user's input, it invokes corresponding methods to perform actions.
      - If the user inputs "exit," the program ends.

3. **Methods:**
   - **buyCoffee:**
      - Allows the user to buy different types of coffee (espresso, latte, cappuccino) or go back to the main menu.
      - Checks if there are enough resources for the selected coffee type and updates the resources accordingly.
   - **fill:**
      - Prompts the user to input amounts of water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups to add to the coffee machine's resources.
   - **takeMoney:**
      - Prints a message indicating the amount of money taken and resets the money counter to zero.
   - **getState:**
      - Prints the current state of the coffee machine, including the amounts of water, milk, coffee beans, disposable cups, and money.

4. **Comments:**
   - There are comments throughout the code explaining each section's functionality, which is good for code readability.
   - Some commented-out code (`setState` method) suggests the intention to allow the user to set initial resource values, but it's currently commented out.

5. **Improvements:**
   - The program could benefit from additional error handling to ensure valid user inputs.
   - The code for buying coffee could be refactored to make it more modular and avoid repetition.
   - The `Coffee` class's implementation is not provided, but it's assumed to contain properties for different types of coffee.

Overall, this is a basic coffee machine simulation with user interaction through the console, allowing users to buy coffee, refill resources, take money, and check the current state of the coffee machine.
